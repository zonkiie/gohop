Go Hosting Panel

## Plan
This should become the Go Hosting Panel. The objective of this software is an open source solution for web hosters which automates the task of setting up and managing virtual hosts and webspace. The software should become so modular that it will be easily extendible and adaptable by third party modules and scripts in several scripting languages.

## Contributors needed
Please contact me if you are interested in contributing to this project.

As I work on this project alongside many other open source projects and my daily job, I don't have much time for each individual project, so the progress may not be very fast.
